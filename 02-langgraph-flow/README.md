# Part 2: LangGraph Flow

A simple cyclical graph (though this example is linear for simplicity) using LangGraph.
It demonstrates State, Nodes, and Edges.

## Flow
1. **Generator Node**: Creates a joke about the topic.
2. **Improver Node**: Takes the joke and makes it punchier.

## Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
